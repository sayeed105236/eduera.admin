"RISK ASSESSMENT (DOMAIN-1)"
""
"(1) Most important step in a risk analysis is to identify:"
"A. competitors."
"B. controls."
"C. vulnerabilities."
"D. liabilities."
""
""
"Answer: C. vulnerabilities."
""
""
"Explanation: If vulnerabilities are not properly identified, controls and audit planning may not be"
"relevant. Vulnerabilities are a key element in the conduct of a risk analysis."
""
""
"(2) In a risk-based audit planning, an IS auditor's first step is to identify:"
"A. responsibilities of stakeholders."
"B. high-risk areas within the organization."
"C. cost centre."
"D. profit centre."
""
""
"Answer: B. high-risk areas within the organization."
""
"Explanation: The first and most critical step in the process is to identify high-risk areas within the"
"organization. Once high-risk areas have been identified, audit planning to be done accordingly."
""
""
"(3) When developing a risk-based audit strategy, an IS auditor should conduct a risk assessment to ensure that:"
""
"A. segregation of duties to mitigate risks is in place."
"B. all the relevant vulnerabilities and threats are identified."
"C. regularity compliance is adhered to."
"D. business is profitable."
""
""
"Answer: B. all the relevant vulnerabilities and threats are identified."
"Explanation: In developing a risk-based audit strategy, it is critical that the risks and vulnerabilities be understood. This will determine the areas to be audited and the extent of coverage."
""
"(4) IS Auditor identified certain threats and vulnerabilities in a business process. Next, an IS auditor should:"
""
"A. identify stakeholder for that business process."
"B. identifies information assets and the underlying systems."
"C. discloses the threats and impacts to management."
"D. identifies and evaluates the existing controls."
""
""
"Answer: D. identifies and evaluates the existing controls."
""
""
"Explanation: Before reaching to any conclusion, IS Auditor should evaluate existing controls and its effectiveness. Upon completion of an audit an IS auditor should describe and discuss with"
"management the threats and potential impacts on the assets."
""
""
"(5) Major advantage of risk-based approach for audit planning is:"
""
"A. Audit planning can be communicated to client in advance."
"B. Audit activity can be completed within allotted budget."
"C. Use of latest technology for audit activities."
"D. Appropriate utilization of resources for high risk areas."
""
""
"Answer: D. Appropriate utilization of resources for high risk areas."
""
""
"Explanation: The risk-based approach is designed to ensure audit time is spent on the areas of"
"highest risk. The development of an audit schedule is not addressed by a risk-based approach. Audit schedules may be prepared months in advance using various scheduling methods. A risk approach does not have a direct correlation to the audit staff meeting time budgets on a particular audit, nor does it necessarily mean a wider variety of audits will be performed in a given year."
""
""
"(6) While determining the appropriate level of protection for an information asset an IS auditor"
"should primarily focus on:"
""
""
"A. Criticality of information asset."
"B. Cost of information asset."
"C. Owner of information asset."
"D. Result of vulnerability assessment."
""
""
"Answer: A. Criticality of information asset."
""
""
"Explanation: The appropriate level of protection for an asset is determined based on the criticality of the assets. Other factors are not that relevant as compared to sensitivity of information asset to business."
""
""
"(7) The decisions and actions of an IS auditor are MOST likely to affect which of the following"
"risks?"
""
""
"A. Inherent"
"B. Detection"
"C. Control"
"D. Business"
""
""
"Answer: B. Detection"
""
""
"Explanation: Detection risks are directly affected by the auditor's selection of audit procedures and techniques. Inherent risks usually are not affected by the IS auditor. Control risks are controlled by the actions of the company's management. Business risks are not affected by the IS auditor."
""
"(8) The risk of an IS auditor certifying existence of proper system and procedures without using an inadequate test procedure is an example of:"
""
""
"A. inherent risk."
"B. control risk."
"C. detection risk."
"D. audit risk."
""
""
"Answer: C. detection risk."
""
""
"Explanation: This is an example of detection risk. Detection risk is the risk that the auditors fail to detect a material misstatement in the financial statements."
""
""
"(9) Overall business risk for a particular threat can be expressed as:"
"A. a product of the probability and impact."
"B. probability of occurrence."
"C. magnitude of impact."
"D. assumption of the risk assessment team."
""
""
"Answer: A. a product of the probability and impact."
""
""
""
"Explanation: Choice A takes into consideration the likelihood and magnitude of the impact and"
"provides the best measure of the risk to an asset. Choice B provides only the likelihood of"
"occurrence. Similarly, choice C considers only the magnitude of the damage and not the possibility of a threat exploiting vulnerability. Choice D defines the risk on an arbitrary basis and is not suitable for a scientific risk management process."
""
""
"(10) An IS auditor is evaluating management's risk assessment of information systems. The IS"
"auditor should FIRST review:"
""
"A. the controls already in place."
"B. the effectiveness of the controls in place."
"C. the mechanism for monitoring the risks related to the assets."
"D. the threats/vulnerabilities affecting the assets."
""
""
"Answer: D. the threats/vulnerabilities affecting the assets."
"Explanation: One of the key factors to be considered while assessing the risks related to the use of various information systems is the threats and vulnerabilities affecting the assets. Similarly, the effectiveness of the controls should be considered during the risk mitigation stage and not during the risk assessment phase. A mechanism to continuously monitor the risks related to assets should be put in place during the risk monitoring function that follows the risk assessment phase."
""
""
"(11) An IS Auditor is reviewing data centre security review. Which of the following steps would an IS auditor normally perform FIRST:"
""
"A. Evaluate physical access control."
"B. Determine the vulnerabilities/threats to the data centre site."
"C. Review screening process for hiring security staff"
"D.Evaluate logical access control."
""
""
"Answer: B. Determine the risks/threats to the data centre site."
"Explanation: During planning, the IS auditor should get an overview of the functions being audited and evaluate the audit and business risks. Choices A and D are part of the audit fieldwork process that occurs subsequent to this planning and preparation. Choice C is not part of a security review."
""
""
"(12) Risk assessment approach is more suitable when determining the appropriate level of"
"protection for an information asset because it ensures:"
""
"A. all information assets are protected."
"B. a basic level of protection is applied regardless of asset value."
"C. appropriate levels of protection are applied to information assets."
"D. only most sensitive information assets are protected."
""
""
"Answer: C. appropriate levels of protection are applied to information assets."
""
""
"Explanation: On the basis of risk assessment, assets are classified according to its criticality. Then appropriate level of security is provided to data as per classification."
""
""
"(13) In a risk-based audit approach, an IS auditor should FIRST complete a (n):"
""
"A. inherent risk assessment."
"B. control risk assessment."
"C. test of control assessment."
"D. substantive test assessment."
""
""
"Answer: A. inherent risk assessment."
""
""
"Explanation: The first step in a risk-based audit approach is to gather information about the"
"business and industry to evaluate the inherent risks. After completing the assessment of the"
"inherent risks, the next step is to complete an assessment of the internal control structure. The"
"controls are then tested and, on the basis of the test results, substantive tests are carried out and assessed."
""
""
"(14) In planning an audit, the MOST critical step is the identification of the:"
"A. areas of high risk."
"B. skill sets of the audit staff."
"C. test steps in the audit."
"D. time allotted for the audit."
""
"Answer: A. areas of high risk."
""
""
"Explanation: When designing an audit plan, it is important to identify the areas of highest risk to"
"determine the areas to be audited. The skill sets of the audit staff should have been considered"
"before deciding and selecting the audit. Test steps for the audit are not as critical as identifying the areas of risk, and the time allotted for an audit is determined by the areas to be audited, which are primarily selected based on the identification of risks."
""
""
"(15) Risk assessment process is:"
""
"A. subjective."
"B. objective."
"C. mathematical."
"D. statistical."
""
""
"Answer: A. subjective."
""
"Explanation: Risk assessment is based on perception of risk officer. There is no defined"
"mathematical or statistical formula for risk assessment. All risk assessment methodologies rely on subjective judgments at some point in the process (e.g., for assigning weightings to the various parameters)."
""
""
"(16) The result of risk management process is used for:"
"A. forecasting profit"
"B. post implementation review."
"C. designing controls"
"D. user acceptance testing."
""
""
"Answer: C. designing controls"
""
""
"Explanation:"
"The ultimate objective of risk management process is to ensure identified risks are managed by"
"designing various controls. The risk management process is about making specific, security-related decisions, such as the level of acceptable risk. Choices A, B and D are not ultimate goals of the risk management process."
""
""
"(17) Managing the risk up to acceptable level is the responsibility of:"
"A. risk management team."
"B. senior business management."
"C. the chief information officer."
"D. the chief security officer."
""
""
"Answer: B. senior business management."
""
""
"Explanation:"
"Senior management cannot delegate their accountability for management of risk. They have the"
"ultimate or final responsibility for the effective and efficient operation of the organization. Choices A, C and D should act as advisors to senior management in determining an acceptable risk level."
""
""
"(18) Evaluation of IT risks can be done by:"
"A. finding threats/vulnerabilities associated with current IT assets."
"B. Trend analysis on the basis of past year losses."
"C. industry benchmark."
"D. reviewing IT control weaknesses identified in audit reports."
""
""
""
""
"Answer: A. finding threats/vulnerabilities associated with current IT assets."
""
""
"Explanation: To assess IT risks, threats and vulnerabilities need to be evaluated using qualitative or\ quantitative risk assessment approaches. Choices B, C and D are potentially useful inputs to the risk assessment process, but by themselves not sufficient."
""
""
"(19) An IS auditor is reviewing payroll application. He identified some vulnerability in the system."
"What would be the next task?"
""
""
"A. Report the vulnerabilities to the management immediately."
"B. Examine application development process."
"C. Identify threats and likelihood of occurrence."
"D. Recommend for new application."
""
""
"Answer: C. Identify threats and likelihood of occurrence."
""
""
"Explanation: The IS auditor must identify the assets, look for vulnerabilities, and then identify the"
"threats and the likelihood of occurrence."
""
""
"(20) Absence of proper security measures represents a (n):"
"A. threat."
"B. asset."
"C. impact."
"D. vulnerability."
""
""
"Answer: D. vulnerability."
""
""
"Explanation:"
"Vulnerability is a weakness or gap in our protection efforts. Vulnerability can be in form of weak"
"coding, missing anti-virus, weak access control and other related factors. Vulnerabilities can be"
"controlled by us. A threat is what we're trying to protect against. Our enemy could be Earthquake, Fire, Hackers, Malware, System Failure, Criminals and many other unknown forces. Threats are not in our control. Lack of adequate security functionality in this context is vulnerability."
""
""
""
""
""

"C. will be in line with overall corporate policy."
"D. ensures consistency across the organization."
""
""
"Answer: B. is derived as a result of a risk assessment."
""
""
"Explanation:"
"A bottom-up approach begins by defining operational-level requirements and policies, which are"
"derived and implemented as the result of risk assessments. Enterprise-level policies are"
"subsequently developed based on a synthesis of existing operational policies. Choices A, C and D are advantages of a top-down approach for developing organizational policies. This approach"
"ensures that the policies will not be in conflict with overall corporate policy and ensure consistency across the organization."
""
""
"(23)Risk can be mitigated by:"
"A. Implementing controls"
"B. Insurance"
"C. Audit and certification"
"D. Contracts and service level agreements (SLAs)"
""
""
"Answer: A. Security and control practices"
""
""
"Explanation:"
"Risks are mitigated by implementing appropriate security and control practices. Insurance is a"
"mechanism for transferring risk. Audit and certification are mechanisms of risk assurance, and"
"contracts and SLAs are mechanisms of risk allocation."
""
""
"(24) Most important factor while evaluating controls is to ensure that the controls:"
"A. addresses the risk"
"B. does not reduce productivity."
"C. is less costly than risk."
"D. is automotive."
""
""
"Answer: A. addresses the risk"
""
""
"Explanation: Though all of the above factors are important, it is essential that control should be able to address the risk. When designing controls, it is necessary to consider all the above aspects. In an ideal situation, controls that address all these aspects would be the best controls."
""
""
"(25) The susceptibility of a business or process to make an error that is material in nature,"
"assuming there were no internal controls."
"A. Inherent risk"
"B. Control risk"
"C. Detection risk"
"D. Correction risk"

"basis."
""
"A. Inherent risk"
"B. Control risk"
"C. Detection risk"
"D. Correction risk"
""
""
"Answer: B. Control risk"
""
""
""
""
"Explanation:"
""
"Control risk means the risk that a misstatement could occur but may not be detected and corrected or prevented by entity's internal control mechanism."
""
""
"(27) Which of the following factors an IS auditor should primarily consider when determining the"
"acceptable level of risk:"
""
""
"A. Risk acceptance is the responsibility of senior management."
"B. All risks do not need to be eliminated for a business to be profitable."
"C. Risks must be identified and documented in order to perform proper analysis on them."
"D. Line management should be involved in the risk analysis because management sees risks daily that others would not recognize."
""
""
"Answer: C. Risks must be identified and documented in order to perform proper analysis on them."
""
""
"Explanation: Though all factors are relevant, primarily consideration should be documentation of identified risk. In order to manage and control a risk, it first must be recognized as a risk. Only after documentation, other factors to be considered."

""
"Answer: D. outline the overall authority, scope and responsibilities of the audit function."
""
""
"Explanation:"
"(1) An audit charter should state management's objectives for and delegation of authority to IS"
"audit."
"(2) Charter should not be significantly changed over time. An audit charter outlines the overall"
"authority, scope and responsibilities of the audit function. An audit charter would not be at a"
"detailed level and therefore frequent updation is not required."
"(3) Audit charter would not include detailed audit calendar and resource allocation."
"(4) Action plan in case of disruption of services is included in BCP policy and not in Audit Charter."
""
""
"(3) Primary purpose of an audit charter is to:"
""
"A. describe audit procedure."
"B. define resource requirement for audit department."
"C. prescribe the code of ethics used by the auditor"
"D.to prescribe authority and responsibilities of audit department."
""
"Answer: D.to prescribe authority and responsibilities of audit department."
""
""
"The correct answer is D. The charter's main purpose is to define the auditor's roles and"
"responsibilities. It should evidence a clear mandate and authority for the auditors to perform their work. Audit procedure, resource requirements and code of ethics will not be a part of audit charter."
""
""
"(4) The document used by the top management of organizations to delegate authority to the IS"
"audit function is the:"
""
"A. audit calendar."
"B. audit charter."

""
"A. Attribute sampling"
"B. Variable sampling"
"C. Random sampling"
"D. Judgmental sampling"
""
""
"Answer: A. Attribute sampling"
""
"Explanation:"
"In any given scenario, attribute sampling method (either control is present or absent) will be useful when testing for compliance. Attribute sampling is the primary sampling method used for"
"compliance testing. Attribute sampling is a sampling model that is used to estimate the rate of"
"occurrence of a specific quality (attribute) in a population and is used in compliance testing to"
"confirm whether the quality exists. The other choices are used in substantive testing, which involves testing of details or quantity."
""
""
"(2) Test to determine whether last 50 new user requisitions were correctly processed is an example of:"
""
"A. discovery sampling."
"B. substantive testing."
"C. compliance testing."
"D. stop-or-go sampling."
""
""
"Answer: C. compliance testing."
""
""
"Explanation:"
"In any given scenario, compliance testing checks for the presence of controls. Compliance testing determines whether controls are being applied in compliance with policy. This includes tests to determine whether new accounts were appropriately authorized. In any given scenario,"
"outcome/result of compliance testing will form the basis for planning of substantive testing. For"
"example, if compliance testing indicates strong internal control, substantive testing may be waived off or reduced. In case of compliance testing indicates weak internal controls then substantive testing to be more rigorous. The development of substantive tests is often dependent on the outcome of compliance tests."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(3) Which of the following is a substantive test?"
""
"A. Reviewing compliance with firewall policy."
"B. Reviewing adherence to change management policy."
"C. Using a statistical sample to inventory the tape library"
"D. Reviewing password history reports"
""
""
"Answer: C. Using a statistical sample to inventory the tape library"
""
""
"Explanation: In any given scenario, substantive testing checks the integrity of contents. A substantive test confirms the integrity of actual processing. A substantive test would determine if the tape library records are stated correctly."
""
""
"(4) Major difference between compliance testing and substantive testing is that compliance testing tests:"
""
""
"A. details, while substantive testing tests controls."
"B. controls, while substantive testing tests details."
"C. financial statements, while substantive testing tests items in trial balance."
"D. internal requirements, while substantive testing tests internal controls."
""
""
"Answer: B. controls, while substantive testing tests details"
""
""
"Explanation: Compliance testing involves determining whether controls exist as designed whereas substantive testing relates to detailed testing of transactions/procedures."
""
""
"(5) When an IS auditor performs a test to ensure that only active users have access to a critical"
"system, the IS auditor is performing a:"
""
"A. compliance test."
"B. substantive test."
"C. statistical sample."
"D. Judgment Sampling."
""
""
"Answer: A. compliance test."
""
""
"Explanation:"
"In any given scenario, compliance testing checks for the presence of controls whereas substantive testing checks the integrity of contents. Compliance tests determine if controls are being applied in accordance with management policies and procedures. In this case, verifying that only active associates are present provides reasonable assurance that a control is in place and can be relied upon."
"(6) IS auditors are MOST likely to reduce substantive test procedure if after compliance test they conclude that:"
""
"A. a substantive test would be too costly."
"B. the control environment is poor."
"C. inherent risk is low."
"D. control risks are within the acceptable limits."
""
""
"Answer: D. control risks are within the acceptable limits."
""
""
"Explanation: In any given scenario, outcome/result of compliance testing will form the basis for planning of substantive testing. For example, if compliance testing indicates strong internal control, substantive testing may be waived off or reduced. In case compliance testing indicates weak internal controls then substantive testing to be more rigorous. The development of substantive tests is often dependent on the outcome of compliance tests. In this case, if control risks are within acceptable limits and hence substantive test procedure can be reduced."

""
"(7) Which of the following is a substantive audit test?"
""
""
"A. Verifying that a management check has been performed regularly"
"B. Observing that user IDs and passwords are required to sign on the computer"
"C. Reviewing reports listing short shipments of goods received"
"D. Reviewing an aged trial balance of accounts receivable"
""
""
"Answer: D. Reviewing an aged trial balance of accounts receivable"
""
""
"Explanation: In compliance testing we gather evidence with the objective of testing an organization's compliance with control procedures. In substantive testing, we gather evidence to evaluate the integrity of data, a transaction or other information. Compliance testing checks for the presence of controls whereas substantive testing checks the integrity of contents. A review of accounts receivable will provide evidence of the validity and propriety of the financial statement balance. Choices A, B and C are compliance tests to determine that policies and procedures are being followed."
""
""
""
"(8) The objective of compliance tests is to ensure:"
"A. controls are implemented as prescribed."

""
"A. A substantive test of program library controls"
"B. A compliance test of program library controls"
"C. A compliance test of the program compiler controls"
"D. A substantive test of the program compiler controls"
""
""
"Answer: B. A compliance test of program library controls"
""
""
"Explanation:"
""
"A compliance test determines if controls are operating as designed and are being applied in a"
"manner that complies with management policies and procedures. For example, if the IS auditor is concerned whether program library controls are working properly, the IS auditor might select a sample of programs to determine if the source and object versions are the same. In other words, the broad objective of any compliance test is to provide auditors with reasonable assurance that a particular control on which the auditor plans to rely is operating as the auditor perceived it in the preliminary evaluation."

"SAMPLING (DOMAIN-1)"
""
"(1)Use of statistical sampling will be more relevant as compared to judgment (non-statistical)"
"sampling when:"
""
"A. it is required to mitigate sampling risk"
"B. auditor is inexperienced"
"C. the probability of error must be objectively quantified"
"D. it is required to mitigate audit risk"
""
"Answer: C. the probability of error must be objectively quantified"
""
""
"Explanation: In any given scenario, statistical sampling is to be used when the probability of error must be objectively quantified (i.e. no subjectivity is involved). Statistical sampling is an objective method of sampling in which each item has equal chance of selection. Choice A is incorrect because sampling risk is the risk of a sample not being representative of the population. This risk exists for both judgment and statistical samples. Also, audit risk is applicable for both judgment and statistical sampling."
""
""
"(2) Statistical sampling reduces which of the following risk:"
""
"A. audit risk"
"B. detection risk"
"C. inherent risk"
"D. sampling risk"
""
""
"Answer: B. detection risk"
""
""
"Explanation:"
"In any given scenario, statistical sampling minimizes the detection risk. Detection risk is the chance that an auditor will not find material misstatements in an entity's financial statements. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor will conclude that no material errors are present when in fact there are. However, using statistical sampling, probability of error can be objectively quantified and hence detection risk can be minimized. Other risks cannot be minimized using statistical sampling."

""
"A. Attribute sampling"
"B. Variable sampling"
"C. Discovery sampling"
"D. Stop or go sampling"
""
""
"Answer: A. Attribute sampling"
""
""
"Explanation:"
"In any given scenario, attribute sampling method (either control is present or absent) will be useful when testing for compliance. Variable sampling is generally used for substantive testing. Discovery sampling is used when objective of audit is to discover fraud or other irregularities. Stop-or-go sampling is used when auditor believes that very few errors will be found. It prevents excessive sampling by allowing an audit test to be stopped at the earliest possible moment."
""
""
"(4)With regard to confidence correlation, it can be said that:"
""
"A. small sample size will give high confidence correlation"
"B. if an auditor knows internal controls are strong, the confidence coefficient may be lowered"
"C. small confidence correlation will result into high sample size"
"D. if an auditor knows internal controls are strong, the confidence coefficient may be increased"
""
""
""
"Answer: B. if an auditor knows internal controls are strong, the confidence coefficient may be"
"Lowered"
""
""
"Explanation:"
"Confidence coefficient is a probability that sample are true representation of the population. In any given scenario, when internal controls are strong, confidence coefficient /sample size may be lowered. Greater the confidence coefficient, higher the sample size or in other way higher the"
"sample size, higher the confidence coefficient."

""
""
"(5) Test to determine whether last 50 new user requisitions were correctly processed is an example of:"
"A. discovery sampling"
"B. substantive testing"
"C. compliance testing"
"D. stop-or-go sampling"
""
""
"Answer: C. compliance testing"
""
"Explanation:"
"In any given scenario, compliance testing checks for the presence of controls. Compliance testing determines whether controls are being applied in compliance with policy. This includes tests to determine whether new accounts were appropriately authorized. In any given scenario,"
"outcome/result of compliance testing will form the basis for planning of substantive testing. For"
"example, if compliance testing indicates strong internal control, substantive testing may be waived off or reduced. In case of compliance testing indicates weak internal controls then substantive testing to be more rigorous. The development of substantive tests is often dependent on the outcome of compliance tests."

"(6) IS auditor reviewing a critical financial application is concerned about fraud. Which of the"
"following sampling methods would BEST assist the auditors?"
""
"A. Attribute sampling"
"B. Variable sampling"
"C. Discovery sampling"
"D. Stop or go sampling"
""
""
"Answer: C. Discovery sampling"
""
""
"Explanation: In any given scenario, Discovery sampling is used when objective of audit is to discover fraud or other irregularities. Discovery sampling is used when an auditor is trying to determine whether a type of event has occurred, and therefore it is suited to assess the risk of fraud and to identify whether a single occurrence has taken place. Stop-or-go-sampling is used when auditor believes that very few errors will be found. It prevents excessive sampling by allowing an audit test to be stopped at the earliest possible moment. Attribute sampling method (either control is present or absent) will be useful when testing for compliance. Variable sampling is generally used for substantive testing."
""
""
""
"(7) Which of the following sampling methods would be the MOST effective to determine whether"
"access rights to staffs have been authorized as per the authorization matrix?"
""
"A. stratified mean per unit"
"B. attribute sampling"
"C. discovery sampling"
"D. stop or go sampling"
""
""
"Answer: B. attribute sampling"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Explanation: Attribute sampling method (either control is present or absent) will be useful when testing for compliance. Either access given as per authorization matrix or not given as per authorization matrix. Discovery sampling is used when an auditor is trying to determine whether a type of event has occurred, and therefore it is suited to assess the risk of fraud and to identify whether a single occurrence has taken place. Stop-or-go-sampling is used when auditor believes that very few errors will be found. It prevents excessive sampling by allowing an audit test to be stopped at the earliest possible moment. Stratified mean per unit and unstratified mean per unit are used in variable sampling."

"(8) An IS auditor is determining the appropriate sample size for testing the effectiveness of change management process. No deviation noted in last 2 years audit review and management has assured no deviation in the process for the period under review. Auditor can adopt a :"
""
""
"A. higher confidence coefficient resulting in a smaller sample size"
"B. lower confidence coefficient resulting in a higher sample size"
"C. higher confidence coefficient resulting in a higher sample size"
"D. lower confidence coefficient resulting in a lower sample size"
""
""
"Answer: D. lower confidence coefficient resulting in a lower sample size"
""
""
"Explanation:"
"In any given scenario, when internal controls are strong, confidence coefficient /sample size may be lowered. Choice A is not correct because higher confidence correlation will always have higher sample size. Choice B is not correct because lower confidence coefficient will always have lower sample size. Choice C is not correct because where internal controls are strong, high confidence correlation or high sample size is not warranted."
